# CorrelatedData
Comparision of Novel Techniques on Independent and Correlated Data
Extraction of web data from different sources through the extractors can be helpful in knowledge driven tasks. However the extracted data may be incorrect and inaccurate in addition to the noise introduced to the data from the
extraction systems. Previous work was proposed and techniques were introduced which are helpful to differentiate the erroneous data from the correct data with correlation model.
In this paper we present our experiences of how we modeled the techniques with independent and correlated data.
